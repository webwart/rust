# Rust Language Learning

1. For my job I need to do software development
2. I do have a lot files and information and need to standadize.

## Goals

1. What do I want to learn / develop / produce? Rust language and DevOps einvironment.
2. Where is it used in production ?
3. Timeline / Deadline ? when ever I have time and interest
4. Deliverable ? Get ready for use of rust-lang when necessary.

## Situation, Reasoning , and nexts tings to do

1. Start: 04-03-2023 new , Start: dd-mm-yyyy name of precurser project
1. What has been done ?

   - Installed rust-lang for Nap-Lap/Rai in C:\Users\raine\.cargo -- NO SYSTEM-WIDE INSTALLATION  
   - Installed rust-lang for Sion-Desk/Rai in C:\Users\raine\.cargo -- NO SYSTEM-WIDE INSTALLATION
   - Created 03_src/rust/rust-book/ , which I use to do the rust-book example. Equavilent to /project/ in the rust book.
   - Created C:\Users\raine\projects , which I use to exactly reproduce the rust-book examples. Removed on 13.01.2023
   - Installed rust-lang for user RAI and ADMIN. I added the rust add-on to VScode
   - Bookmarked the rust-book in Edge/Favoritenleiste/rust.
   - Bookmarked the Brown.Edu rust-book in Edge/Favoritenleiste/rust. 
   - GitHub set-up is made on Sion-Desk with passkey. Authorization with Windows Account Log-In (Windows Hello)

2. What did not work ?

     None

3. What are the resources (time, finance, energy) ?

     - I will invest 10 hours to find out, what is it all about.

4. What are Concepts, Diagrams, Reasoning, Outlook.

- Install the latest stable version of Rust using rustup. Update to a newer Rust version: `rustup update`. Open locally installed documentation: `rustup doc`. Update rustup itself: `rustup self update`.
- Write and run a “Hello, world!” program using rustc directly, but is recommanded to use Cargo.
- Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo: `cargo new <projectName>`, `cargo run`, cargo`check`. Cargo uses a .toml file to manage the build.

>N: Next thing to do

## Prerequits for SPs

- What intepreter / virtuell machine / packages / modules / files / folders
- Do I have git ? Which server repository ?
- Where is this code synced to ? How ?
- Does is run on Win10 , ubespace , android ?

>SP: Document structure and procedure

``` text
USE----name of structure to use
CREAT--folder, file, object etc.  
COPY---"01_ProjectTemplate.md" into new \folder\ and change
     --the of the file to 00_<Name of folder>.md
VERB---documention of set-up, SP and progress (Journal section)  
```
